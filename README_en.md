# Bakabakaband

Baka means "stupid" in Japanese. Bakabakaband is Hengband's variant for purpose of Deskull's personal sandbox of \*band and \*NASTY\* hobby, developed in the following directions.

 * Abolish "permanent death" and resurrection by stupid reasons.
 * Stupid monsters and items that have no regard for game balance.
 * Parody of Stupid Internet Memes on Japanese Websites.
 * Enhanced elements of crossover fanfiction since Zangband. (I'll be frank. I like Zelazny, Moorcock, Warhammer and so on, but I hate only Tolkien's religious worldview.) 
 * Extreme and experimental new systems.

We may add an English version soon, but for the time being it will be in Japanese only.

Abandon All Honest, Ye Who Enter Here.
